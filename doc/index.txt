The Python ``tox`` project aims to pave a new way to automate packaging, testing and release of Python software.  

Install
=============

Use one of the following commands::

   pip install tox  # or 
   easy_install tox 

Features:
=============

* `tox` command line tool for starting packaging and testing

* `tox` package for driving things directly from Python

* automatic creation of virtual environments

* test-tool agnostic: runs nose, unittest or py.test style tests in a uniform manner

* clean packaging: allows to specify files of a distribution

* cross-Python compatible: handles Python2.4 up to Python3.1, Jython

* (and soon PyPy-c after it grows virtualenv support)

Basic Example 
================================

Put basic information about your project and the test environments you
want your project to run in into a ``tox.ini`` file::

    # content of: tox.ini
    [test]
    command=py.test --junitxml={envname}.xml 
    [testenv:py25]
    python=python2.5
    [testenv:py26]
    python=python2.6

To package, install and test the project, you can type at the command prompt
(in your project root directory where your ``tox.ini`` and ``setup.py`` file should reside)::

    tox test

This will sdist-package your current project, create virtualenv_
Environments, install the package into the environments and run
the specified command in them - in this case py.test_ which 
creates XML result files which can be further processed 
by Continous Integration Servers.  Sometimes it is useful to 
rather run from a Python script because they work across
Win32 and Linux uniformly::

    import tox
    tox.cmdline("test")
