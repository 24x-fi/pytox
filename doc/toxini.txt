tox configuration
================================

.. _ConfigParser: http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html

``tox.ini`` files uses the standard ConfigParser_ "ini-style" format. 
Below you find the specification, you might want to skim some 
:doc:`examples` first. 

Global settings
----------------------

List of optional global options::

    [global]
    toxworkdir=path      # tox directory, defaults to .tox
    packagedir=path  # defaults to dirpath of tox.ini file
    logdir=path      # defaults to {toxworkdir}/log

Test environment settings 
------------------------------

Test environments are defined by a::

    [testenv:NAME]
    ...

section.  Defaults for each setting come from the::

    [test]
    ...

testenvironment default section. 

Complete list of settings that you can put into ``testenv*`` sections:

``python=NAME-OR-PATH``
    name or path to a Python interpreter which will be used for creating
    the virtual environment. 

``argv=MULTI-LINE``
    the test command to be called for testing. Each line defines one 
    item of a list that will be passed to ``subprocess.Popen``. 

``tmpdir=path``
    XXX defines a temporary directory of the virtualenv, 
    available via the ``envtmpdir`` substition, defaults to 

``deps=MULTI-LINE-LIST``
    dependencies to be installed into the environment prior to project
    package installation.  Each line defines a dependency, which will be
    passed to easy_install/pip for processing. 

``changedir=path``
    change to this working directory when executing the test command. 
    **default**: package setup directory. 

``downloadcache=path``
    (pip only) use this directory for caching downloads - this defaults to the 
    environment variable ``PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` if it is set. 
    **default**: no download cache will be used. 
    **note**: if creating multiple environments use of a download cache greatly 
    speeds up the testing process. 

    [testenv:NAME]   # a section defininig a virtualenv test environment
    python=name-or-path   # name of Python intepreter, to be found on system path

``distribute=BOOL``
    Set to ``True`` if you want to use distribute in the virtual environment. 
    **default:** False. (setuptools will be used)

Substitutions
---------------------

Settings can generally use string-substitution like this::

    changedir={envtmpdir} 

Global substitutions
